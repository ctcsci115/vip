      <h2>DAIRY PRODUCTS</h2>
      <p>Vancouver Island is home to many dairy farms. A few of the smaller farms have taken a more direct approach in
        bringing their dairy products to islanders. Two particular farms, located in the Cowichan Valley area offer
        fresh milk directly from their dairy. Both farms sell the bottled milk at their individual stands at their farm,
        and one offers a home delivery service that will deliver your milk order as well as other local island products
        that
        they offer, which include produce, coffee, meat to name a few.
